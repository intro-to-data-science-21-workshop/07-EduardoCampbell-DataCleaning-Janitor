# Cleaning Dirty Data with Janitor  

## Summary 

This short student-run workshop is part of the course I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop at the Hertie School, Berlin. It will take place in November 2021. The purpose of this workshop is to introduce students to the Janitor Package and teach them how to use the package to clean dirty data sets. 

This repository contains the materials students will need for the interactive tutorial and two datasets they will need to conduct their analysis.

## Session Content 

The workshop session has two parts. 

Part 1 is a pre-recorded presentation that introduces students to the Janitor package, motivates them to use it, and introduces them to some of janitor's key functions. Some of the key janitor functions covered include:

- clean_names()
- row_to_names()
- remove_empty()
- get_dupes
- tabyl()
- crosstabulation: adorn_totals(), adorn_percentages(), adorn_pct_formatting ()

Part 2 is an interactive tutorial, where students will have an opportunity to practice using the janitor package. Students will use the functions above, plus others, to clean a typical 'dirty dataset'.

## Main learning objectives

By the end of our workshop session, we hope that students will be able to:

1. Use janitor functions to clean a typical 'dirty dataset', including removing unnecessary columns and rows, creating readable column names, and locating duplicates.
2. Understand how janitor integrates with the rest of the tidyverse and can be used in tandem with other tidyverse packages to quickly clean data
3. Use janitor functions to quickly create tables, which include clear labels
